# Rocket Factory Tycoon
## A C# GUI-based game application using the clicker model.

This project was developed by a team of two students as part of an academic assignment. The goal was to **design and implement a GUI-based desktop application** using Microsoft Visual Studio IDE 2022, **a minimum of five features implemented by each team member**

## Project Overview

1) **User Requirement Analysis**
A user manual was created to ensure that any user can easily understand and navigate the application.

3) **Project Proposal**
The proposal outlines the project objectives, start and end dates, team members, and a description of the application's functionality and features. It presents the value of the project to potential evaluators (teacher, investor, or employer).

4) **Coding and Debugging**
The application was built using C# and WinForms. The team collaborated to implement interactive features, debug functionality, and test for a smooth user experience.

5) **Software Release**
A complete and working version of the application was delivered at the end of the development process.

6) **Presentation & Demonstration**
The final project was presented in class, including a live demonstration of the application’s features using PowerPoint slides.
